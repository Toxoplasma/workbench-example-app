Major stuff:


Actual pathfinding
Should be able to go backwards to previous maps


Minor stuff:
Make the farm house doors not always leftmost/uppermost on the wall they're on
highscores 
Make you drop a gun when you pick up a new one
Have better and correctly sized pictures for stuff... auto sizing looks kinda bad
put a cap on the number of items the player can have

Bugs:
spitter spit being able to go through walls and also be invisible sometimes
zombies sometimes not hitting you when they're next to you
zombies splooping back and forth because doubles
