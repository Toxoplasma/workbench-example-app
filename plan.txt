Major stuff:


Actual pathfinding
Should be able to go backwards to previous maps

Switch to a priority system for drawing
switch to a queue for movement?

add a max range for throwing

Make the direction picking for sprites octagons instead of the current thing

Minor stuff:
Make the farm house doors not always leftmost/uppermost on the wall they're on
highscores 
Make you drop a gun when you pick up a new one
put a cap on the number of items the player can have
add a max to the ammo bar display for the mini chars
make thrown items spawn at the closest available square
make chargers no longer count as charging if they start sliding along a wall and being really slow
	Thrown items too
	Loop the step until they've moved the required distance, or until it's taken like double the steps it should have been then mark it done

Bugs:
spitter spit being able to go through walls and also be invisible sometimes
Fix the spitter acid icon @_@
fire sometimes persisting on dead actors
Weird bug - thrown molotov hit a tank and ricoched to some weird place but moved more slowly after it?
jane gets stuck in walls sometimes


Eventual:
Better human ai
Humans with items
Real image rotations (i.e. seeing the back of their head, side view, etc)
Accuracy? possibly movement-based
or just movement-based range, i.e. double range when stopped and certain guns can't fire while moving
grenade targetting to pick densest cluster or something rather than closest
